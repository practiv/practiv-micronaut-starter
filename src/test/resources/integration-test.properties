# As one of the final pre-defined build steps; the docker image that is created will be run, and the build will only pass 
# if the application starts up correctly. Here you can supply any values required to be able to run the app container for the integration step. 

# For instance if you connect to a DB at startup:
# datasource.url=jdbc://my-host:5123/mydb

# Optionally, test files can be created `MyIntegrationTest.java` to run tests against this container in this step. Naming convention is key here.
